# EthicalBruteForceAutomation
This repository contains an automated brute-force script designed for educational purposes and ethical hacking. The script demonstrates password-cracking techniques under controlled environments and is intended for use in legal penetration testing and security research only. Unauthorized or malicious use is strictly prohibited. 
# Purpose
The goal of this project is to automate a brute-force attack on a login page, specifically Instagramâ€™s login form, using the Selenium WebDriver. The script attempts to log in by systematically testing passwords from a provided password file until the correct password is found.

Note: This project is for educational purposes only and should only be used in controlled environments where permission has been explicitly granted. Unauthorized brute-force attacks on live websites or services are illegal and unethical.

# Scope
This project:

Automates login attempts to a website using usernames and passwords from files.
Demonstrates how Selenium can be used for automating browser-based interactions, such as brute-force attacks.
